## **PATIENT DIABETES PREDICTION.**  
---

### **Background & Objectives**  
---
Also known as _diabtes mellitus_, Diabetes is a disease characterized by sustained high blood sugar levels. This is caused by either of two things:  
(a) the pancreas not producing enough insulin or  
(b) the body cells becoming unresponsive to hormonal effects.  

Common symptons of diabetes include excessive thirst, excessive unrination, weight loss, blured vision and extreme hunger.  

Treatment for diabetes features insulin replacement therapy (most commmon treatment for type1 diabetes)  
and anit-diabetic medications which happens to be the most commong treatment for type 2 diabetes.  

### **Problem Statement**  
---
Early detection and prevention in medicine remains a desired outcome of all diagnosis of diseases of any kind. Diabetes posoes significant health risks if not diagnosed and managed early. Using a dataset with key health indicators such as glucose levels, BMI and blood pressure, this project aimes to develop a predictive model to classify individuals as *diabetic* or _non-diabetic_. This makes a step towards achieving the goal to provide a tool for early detection and intervention, untlimatly contributing to better healthcare outcomes and disease management.

### **Aim of Project**  
---
This project aims to achieve the following:  
1. **Accuractely predict instances of diabetes among new patients**  

2.  **Feature Importance Analysis**  
    - Determine most influential factors(features) leading to diabetes risk, relating to features in the dataset  
    - Identify critical thresholds for high-risk features  
3. **Risk Stratification**  
    - categorize patients into low, medium or high diabetes risk based on feature values  
    - Create scoring system to estimate the likelihood of developing diabetes  

4. **Threshold Analysis**  
    - Optimal cutoffs for early intervention  
    - at what glucose level does the risk of diabetes spike? 
    - how much BMI reduction would lower diabetes risk significantly?  

5. **Health Recommendations/Data Driven Policies**  
    - Provide recommendations based on patterns and insights drawn from the dataset.  
    - Develop early detection strategies (e.g a checlist of early warning signs)
